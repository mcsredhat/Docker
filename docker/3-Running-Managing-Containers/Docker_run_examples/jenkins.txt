### 2. **Ensure Network is Set Up**

# Ensure that the Docker network `my-network` exists. If it does not, you can create it using:
docker network ls

#if not created 

docker network create --driver bridge my-network


---

### 3. **Verify Permissions on Host Volume**

Ensure that the directory `/host/jenkins_home` on your host system is accessible by Docker and that it has the appropriate permissions.

To set the correct permissions for `/host/jenkins_home`:

sudo mkdir /host/jenkins_home
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /host/jenkins_home
sudo chmod 755 /host/jenkins_home


This ensures that the `jenkins` container has read/write permissions to the host directory.


### 4. **Run the Docker Command**

Once you’ve verified the prerequisites and set up everything, execute the `docker run` command. Make sure you're using the correct path for `/host/jenkins_home`.


docker run -d \
  --name jenkins-server \
  --hostname jenkins-host \
  --network my-network \
  --ip 172.16.16.114 \
  --publish 8088:8080 \
  --publish 50050:50000 \
  --env TZ=UTC \
  --memory=4g \
  --cpus="2.0" \
  --pids-limit=500 \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --volume /host/jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home \
  --label app=jenkins \
  --label environment=production \
  --health-cmd="curl --fail http://localhost:8080 || exit 1" \
  --health-interval=30s \
  --health-retries=3 \
  --health-timeout=10s \
  --health-start-period=15s \
  jenkins/jenkins:lts


### 6. **Check the Container Status**

After executing the command, confirm the container is running using:


docker ps


You should see the `jenkins-server` container listed as running.

### 7. **Access Jenkins Web Interface**

Once the container is up and running, open your browser and go to:


http://localhost:8080


In your case, replace `<host-ip>` with the server’s IP address, which is `172.16.16.114`. So you should visit:


http://172.16.16.114:8088


You should see the Jenkins setup wizard.

### 8. **Unlock Jenkins (First Time Setup)**

* Jenkins generates an initial password during the first startup.
* To retrieve the password, run the following command:


docker exec jenkins-server cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword


This will print the Jenkins unlock password to the console. Copy it.

* Paste this password into the web interface to unlock Jenkins.

### 9. **Install Suggested Plugins**

After unlocking Jenkins, you will be prompted to install the recommended plugins. It’s best to install the suggested plugins unless you have specific needs for a custom setup.

### 10. **Create an Admin User**

Once the plugins are installed, you will be asked to create an admin user. Provide the necessary details and proceed.

### 11. **Verify Jenkins Functionality**

* After Jenkins is set up, you can verify that it is working by creating a simple job (e.g., a Freestyle project) and running it.
* You can also install additional plugins such as Git or Docker to extend Jenkins functionality.
